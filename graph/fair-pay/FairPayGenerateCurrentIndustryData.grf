/*
  Create the temporary tables required for generating 
  reports for first-cut at fair pay using glass door salary
  data. Ultimately, we should try to put enough information
  needed into our data warehouse which could be used to
  generate reports in the future. All of this code was
  written under an extreme time crunch. There are many
  hacks done to get around vertica's limitations (such
  as no pivot and minimal support for variables.)
  
  The tables here are temporary because they are specific to
  the hard-coded industry we are checking. Ideally, we could
  make a stored proc that takes industry name, but at time 
  of this writing, did not want to go down that rabbit hole
  because vertica has their own quirky way of handling 
  pseudo stored procedures. Also, I don't think they support
  returning tables.
*/

/*
  TMP_PARAM_CUR_INDUSTRY
  This is something of a hack to set parameters (e.g. min_jobs)
  Could use vertica params by placing a dollarsign{param_name}dollarsign 
  directly in code. I don't like that option because I have to deal with
  a dialog box and could not find a way to suppress that. Also,
  dialog box won't let me just hit the enter key to dismiss.
  I have to actually use my mouse to click on the "Done" button.
  (Tabbing to the button does not work for some reason.)
